Mini project
The purpose of this Mini Project is to build an application developed through Python and Flask. 

The mini project will work on the following aspects of Cloud applications:

    REST-based service interface.
    Interaction with external REST services.
    Use of on an external Cloud database for persisting information.
    Support for cloud scalability, deployment in a container environment.
    Cloud security awareness.

    The base application complies the following requirements:

        The application provides a dynamically generated REST API. The API must have a sufficient set of services for the selected application domain. 
        
        The REST API responses conform to REST standards (e.g. response codes).
        
        The application makes use of an external REST service to complement its functionality.
        The application uses a cloud database for accessing persistent information.
        
        The application code is well documented (in each of the code files, as well as in the README.MD file of the git repository).
